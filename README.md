## Contributing
To add to this project, or to use it to start your own, download the index.html file and edit that. 
Then drag the new file into the [Itty Bitty editor](https://itty.bitty.site/edit) to generate the new URL. 
Since all the website data is hosted inside the URL, there is no way to alter the website at the current link (the current link *is* the website).

## Linking
The full URL is quite long (as it contains the entire website), so it may be more practical to use the shortened link. A QR code can also be used.
